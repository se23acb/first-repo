Ethical issue (Consequentialist perspective);\
Though client may tend to have short-term benefits in form of emotional support and reduced stigma from using the service for help but, from a consequential point of view, there is the issue of data privacy and confidentiality.\
- in terms of storing client sensitive data, probably sharing with third-parties, and whether the data is appropriately protected.\
- in terms of making critical diagnosis without having proper training and authorisation from proper regulatory bodies\
- effect of breaching privacy and trust (client sensitive information\'97mental health, emotional experiences, personal information\'97may be exposed or used without proper safeguarding)\
- false sense of security (if client believes the information from the chatbot, it could lead to client seeking wrong medication/therapy and delay seeking professional help\'97lead to longterm harm)\
From consequentialist perspective, the harm caused by risk of misuse of sensitive data and risk of inaccurate/misleading advice outweigh the benefits the chatbot may offer in terms of immediate emotional relief for client. Though client may experience short-term support from chatbot, the long-term consequences such as compromised privacy, potential data breaches, and the possible delay of appropriate professional care pose significant risks to her well-being.\

EthicalOS toolkit;\

=======
In the case of Ade and her parents\'92 use of the chatbot service (AI), the most relevant risk zone from the Ethical OS Toolkit is Implicit Trust and User Understanding. This zone focuses on how user/personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, and the potential unintended consequences when sensitive information is mishandled or without sufficient safeguards. To justify choice;\
- considering Ade is a minor using the AI chatbot service to discuss mental health matters raises concerns on privacy and data security issues. Children and minors tend to to vulnerable when it comes to data privacy, and the chatbot use of this data for model training, without clear disclosure or safeguards of how the data is handled, amplifies these concerns\
- also the fact that Ade\'92s sensitive mental health information such as potential trauma or struggles with low mood is being collected raises questions about consent, data ownership, and security. Without clear understanding and transparency, there is a strong risk that her privacy could be compromised. Given Ade\'92s age, it is especially important to consider how this data could be misused or exploited in ways that she or her parents might not fully understand.\
- ultimately, the unintended consequences of exposing or misusing sensitive data could cause emotional harm to Ade, damage her trust in digital mental health tools, and even have along-term consequences for her well-being. This makes data privacy and security the main concern in this scenario.\
