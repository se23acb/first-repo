<<<<<<< HEAD
This line of code adds an access point (ap1) to the Mininet-WiFi network with specific parameters:

1. *ap1 = net.addAccessPoint('ap1', mac='00:11:22:33:44:01', ...*: This creates an access point named ap1 with the given MAC address. 

2. *ssid='ap1'*: Sets the SSID (Service Set Identifier), which is the network name, to "ap1". Devices will identify this network by its SSID.

3. *mode='g'*: Configures the access point to operate in IEEE 802.11g mode, providing speeds up to 54 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. This setting is essential for compatibility with 802.11g devices.

4. *channel='1'*: Sets the Wi-Fi channel to 1. This determines the specific frequency within the 2.4 GHz band.

5. *position='0,110,0'*: Specifies the 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of the access point on the network's simulated physical grid. 

6. *band='5'*: Sets the frequency band to 5 GHz, allowing the AP to operate on the 5 GHz band if supported by the devices.

7. *range=35*: Defines the coverage range of the access point as 35 meters, which determines the area within which devices can connect to this AP.

8. *failMode="standalone"*: Sets the failure mode of the access point to "standalone", meaning the AP will continue to operate independently if it loses connection to a controller.

This line effectively creates an access point ap1 with specific parameters that define its Wi-Fi settings, range, and fail-safe behavior.

RESPONSIBLE TECHNOLOGY
GDPR principle 1 : lawfulness, fairness, and transparency
Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent 
manner in relation to the data subject (in this case customers of Hamid).
They have the right to their information/data being processed in the 
required manner (on legal basis).
Hamid needs to be mindful of the requirements of first principle before 
taking any action. 
there should be consent from his clients

wifi-adhoc cont.
switches work on logic gates, closing and opening gates
with router in addition, the 
switches are faster than routers, due to direct operation on logic gates

why SDN?
traffic programming
new traffic pattern
monitoring, centralisation, security(access control)
agility, heterogeneity, network automation
internet favouring
lower capital and operation expenditure
mMTC
CDN
VoIP
URLLC
V2V
V2X

control plane?
- logic plane behind operation of a device. only one device controlling the 
entire route of the network
- 

data forwarding plane?
- switching plane/part
- responsible for the actual moving of data
anchor points - abstraction of a database server (safe bandwidth)

ONOS, ODL, Floodlight, NOX, POX, Ryu
- configures networked devices
- 

control plane must express this behaviours
- isolated, traffic prog.,

network functions virtualisation
- decoupling fns from dedicated hardware network devices into 
software applications(simulation)
- it can also have the functionality of SDN


RESPONSIBLE TECHNOLOGY
- Law( given or set of rules by higher authority, something we are bound by within society )
- Ethics( concerned about right and wrong thing to do in a given situation eg. should we do this?, what impact on society might occur )
- Professionalism( consider how law and ethics apply to you in your field of work )

 Environmental sustainability( influence and impact we have on the society/environment )
 Accessibility( access by everyone regardless of their disability is an essential aspect, not excluding, making it an ethical and legal concern )
	disabilty( interaction between an individual's mental or physical impairment and their environment including technological ) models;
		medical model( Equality Act 2010; any physical/mental impairment that affects a person's ability to do normal daily activities )
		social model( concerned with how a society is organised impacts the extent to which one may be disabled, not a disability of an individual )
		biopsychosocial model( concerned with how physical/mental interaction with their environment makes them disable )
		human-rights model( continuum of human traits/capacities, persons with disability have same human-rights as any other person )
