task1
  wireless network design for a department floor
  consist five access points and three stations, aunthentication for AP access
  simulate mobility, observe node handoff from one AP to another
  full ping connectivity between all stations
  describe wireless networks and medium access

task2
  setup adhoc network for use in emergency scenario
  3 stations( A, B, C )
**configure wifi nodes with adhoc protocol
- tested VoIP between close stations with various manet protocols;
> batmand
> batman_adv
> olsrd
**analysis
- Session Initiation Protocol( SIP ): for voice/video call over internet
- average bandwidth of network under each protocol
- behaviours: similar/different
- hidden node problem: node A & C are not aware of each other, but B is aware of bothe A & 
C

task3
  connect new building with old building at UH
  old building has servers
  attain hosts connectivity to all servers
**configure route on host in linux
- ip route add default via <gateway> dev <interface> - for all networks
- ip route add <network>/<netmask> via <gateway> dev <interface> - specify network
**UDP communication
- iperf -s -u -p <port> -i 1 -: listen on server side
- iperf -c <srvr-add> -u -p <port> -t <time> -b <bandwidth> -: connect on client
**analysis
- observe UDP comm for 600s at 100Mb/sec port=5566
- study jitter statistic on client side
- identify consistency or not, meaning for UDP
- iperf command for the test

task4
  test multicast video streaming facility in the new building
  achieve casting to specific host from Video Source
  implement multicast group
**multicast group configuration
- echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_braodcasts
- ip route add <multicast add>/<netmask> dev <interface>
**analysis
- devices in multicast group should be able to stream the video from source
- other devices not in multicast group cannot stream video output
- protocol underlying video stream( Real-Time Transport Protocol ): a form of UDP connection.
