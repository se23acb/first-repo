task3
  connect new building with old building at UH
  old building has servers
  attain hosts connectivity to all servers
**configure route on host in linux
- ip route add default via <gateway> dev <interface> - for all networks
- ip route add <network>/<netmask> via <gateway> dev <interface> - specify network
**UDP communication
- iperf -s -u -p <port> -i 1 -: listen on server side
- iperf -c <srvr-add> -u -p <port> -t <time> -b <bandwidth> -: connect on client
**analysis
- observe UDP comm for 600s at 100Mb/sec port=5566
- study jitter statistic on client side
- identify consistency or not, meaning for UDP
- iperf command for the test

task4
  test multicast video streaming facility in the new building
  achieve casting to specific host from Video Source
  implement multicast group
**multicast group configuration
- echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_braodcasts
- ip route add <multicast add>/<netmask> dev <interface>
**analysis
- devices in multicast group should be able to stream the video from source
- other devices not in multicast group cannot stream video output
